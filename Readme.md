# PaperPath

PaperPath is a full-stack research paper learning platform that helps users discover, save, read, and interact with academic papers through an AI-powered tutor experience. The project combines a React frontend, an Express backend, MongoDB storage, and local AI inference for paper understanding and question answering.

---

## 1. Project Overview

PaperPath is designed for students, researchers, and curious learners who want to:

- browse and explore research papers,
- save papers to a personal library,
- track what they have read,
- upload datasets in PDF or CSV format,
- ask questions about papers through an AI tutor.

The application is split into two main parts:

- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB

---

## 5. Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, make sure you have:

- Node.js 16 or newer
- npm or pnpm
- MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance
- Ollama installed and running locally
- A browser to view the frontend

### Install Ollama
If you want the AI features to work, install Ollama and pull the required models:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
ollama pull qwen2.5:0.5b
```

Then make sure Ollama is running on:

```text
http://localhost:11434
```

---

## 6. Installation Guide

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd PaperPath
```

### Step 2: Install backend dependencies

```bash
cd Paper_Path_Backend
npm install
```

### Step 3: Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd ../Paper_Path_Frontend
npm install
```

---

## 7. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the backend folder based on the example file:

```bash
cp ../.env.example .env
```

Example values:

```env
PORT=3001
MONGO_DB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_if_needed
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### Notes
- `MONGO_DB_URL` is required for database connectivity.
- `JWT_SECRET` is required for authentication.
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is used by the frontend to call the backend.
- The current AI flow uses local Ollama rather than Gemini, so local Ollama must be running for AI features to work.

---

## 8. Running the Project Locally

### Start the backend

```bash
cd Paper_Path_Backend
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on:

```text
http://localhost:3001
```

### Start the frontend

Open a second terminal:

```bash
cd Paper_Path_Frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 9. API Overview

The backend exposes the following API groups:

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `GET /api/auth/profile`

### Papers
- `GET /api/papers`
- `GET /api/papers/:paperId`
- `POST /api/papers/:paperId/ask`
- `POST /api/papers/upload`

### User library
- `GET /api/users/library`
- `POST /api/users/save/:paperId`
- `POST /api/users/history/:paperId`

These routes are used by the React frontend through the API service layer.

---

## 10. How the App Works

### Flow overview
1. A user registers or logs in.
2. The frontend fetches papers from the backend.
3. The user can save papers and view reading history.
4. The user can open a paper in the reader view.
5. The AI tutor can answer questions based on paper content and retrieved context.
6. Uploading a PDF or CSV stores the content in MongoDB and makes it searchable.

---

## 11. Frontend Deployment on Netlify

To deploy the frontend on Netlify, use the following settings:

- Base directory: `Paper_Path_Frontend`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Functions directory: leave empty

### Environment variable for Netlify
Add this environment variable in Netlify:

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com/api
```

Replace `your-backend-domain.com` with the actual URL of your deployed backend.

---

## 12. Backend Deployment Suggestions

The backend can be deployed on services such as:

- Render
- Railway
- Cyclic
- Fly.io
- VPS or cloud server

### Important deployment notes
- Make sure MongoDB Atlas is reachable from the deployed backend.
- Set your environment variables securely in the hosting platform.
- If you deploy the backend, update the frontend environment variable to point to the new backend URL.
- If using a cloud deployment, ensure CORS is enabled correctly for your frontend domain.

---

## 13. Troubleshooting

### Backend not starting
- Check whether MongoDB is reachable.
- Confirm your `.env` values are correct.
- Make sure dependencies are installed.

### Frontend cannot connect to backend
- Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set correctly.
- Confirm the backend is actually running.
- Check for CORS issues if frontend and backend are on different domains.

### AI features not working
- Ensure Ollama is installed and running.
- Verify the required models are downloaded.
- Check that the backend can reach `http://localhost:11434`.

## 14. Future Improvements

Possible enhancements for the project include:

- user profile customization,
- paper search and filtering improvements,
- full-text search and ranking,
- better AI summarization,
- admin dashboard for managing uploaded content,
- improved deployment automation with CI/CD.
